I am honored to be provided an opportunity to describe my career history and future objectives. As a matter of course, we live in a world where technology has become a necessity to live life with ease and to make technology dig deep down into usefulness is a constant aim to pursue for computer engineers, like me. If we can program a computer to learn, that is, to improve its performance through experience, we can achieve Artificial Intelligence to outperform its very creator: the human himself, in many aspects. This has absolutely fascinated me to explore the way one can communicate efficiently with computers and prompt them to act as humans.  
Starting from my childhood days, being a school student, I have had a strong aptitude for science subjects with a constant urge to experiment and try out new things. I burnt the midnight oil to prove my mettle with successful results.
For my undergraduate studies, I chose to study Electrical Engineering to get better understanding on computer hardware as well as its architecture. I secured admission in the Electrical Engineering department of National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, one of the best universities of Taiwan. I am happy to state that I obtained “the outstanding student award” in my undergraduate studies, being the first rank in the batch. Like a duck in the water, I was quickly absorbing and assimilating knowledge in subjects like Programming Languages, Computer Architecture, Data Structures and Algorithm.
After graduating from undergraduate I did some self-study to enhance my programming skills. I want to use those skills to innovate the Computer Science area, precisely, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence and App Development. I wish to train and teach computer via data science tools. Then, by using those achieved results design user interfaces to interact with sensor and so forth. I enjoy designing customized user interface using android studio. In deep learning, I have learnt object detection using YOLO which can help save lives. In fact, by detecting moving objects around the car and alerting the driver, YOLO enhances safety when pulling out of a parking space, helping give drivers better awareness of their surroundings and increased peace of mind.
Furthermore, as a Computer Professional, I would like to contribute my innovative ideas and knowledge to the development of research in Taiwan and to the society by implementing my problem-solving skills and expertise into practice. I will do my best to be an asset to Taiwan and its society.
I would like to end by saying that I am fully aware that a career in research and academics requires a high level of intelligence, unwavering dedication and a lot of sacrifice. I am confident that I would meet all the above demands, and would prove my mettle in being the best researcher and inventor in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things and Apps development.
 Hence, I appeal to the Graduate Admissions Committee to consider me for admission.

Yours Sincerely, Adama ZOUMA.
